# Neighborly
This app was created as a part of /hack hackathon in Galvanize, SF. This app serves the aim to help anyone and everyone when you need any help. All you have to do is just select the category in the app and it will list out all the available people nearby who have registered and are ready to help and you can select anyone based on their credit points and customer reviews.
